Verse 1 (Chris Martin):
The sun rises over the horizon
I feel a new day has come
The warmth on my face, I'm alive
I hear the sound of a new song

So come let's sing together
With our hearts and our souls
Our voices will unite forever
In a harmony we'll never let go

We come from different worlds
But music knows no bounds
Our melodies will intertwine
In a rhythm that astounds

So come let's sing together
With our hearts and our souls
Our voices will unite forever
In a harmony we'll never let go

We'll dance beneath the stars
And let our spirits soar
Our hearts will beat as one
As we sing forevermore

Our voices will unite forever
In a harmony we'll never let go

In a symphony that's never played.

Verse 1:
In the streets of Mumbai
Where the colors come alive
I see a boy with a dream
He's searching for the light

Then the music starts to play
And the world begins to change
The rhythm of his heartbeat
Will guide him to his fate

Chorus:
So don't give up tonight
Hold on to your dreams, don't hide
Let the music lead the way
And take you to a brand new day

Verse 2:
In the misty hills of England
Where the silence greets the dawn
I see a girl with a voice
She's searching for a song

Then the melody fills the air
And the words begin to flow
The power of her fire
Will guide her to her home

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Every note, every beat
Takes us to a different street
And we'll find our way
Through the darkness and the grey

(Chorus)

Outro:
So let's dance to the sunrise
With our hearts and souls alive
The world is waiting for us
To make our dreams come to life
```

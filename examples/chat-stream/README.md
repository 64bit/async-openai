Verse 1 (Chris Martin):
The sun rises over the horizon
I feel a new day has come
The warmth on my face, I'm alive
I hear the sound of a new song

Chorus (Chris Martin and AR Rahman):
So come let's sing together
With our hearts and our souls
Our voices will unite forever
In a harmony we'll never let go

Verse 2 (AR Rahman):
We come from different worlds
But music knows no bounds
Our melodies will intertwine
In a rhythm that astounds

Chorus (Chris Martin and AR Rahman):
So come let's sing together
With our hearts and our souls
Our voices will unite forever
In a harmony we'll never let go

Bridge (AR Rahman):
We'll dance beneath the stars
And let our spirits soar
Our hearts will beat as one
As we sing forevermore

Chorus (Chris Martin and AR Rahman):
So come let's sing together
With our hearts and our souls
Our voices will unite forever
In a harmony we'll never let go

Outro (Chris Martin and AR Rahman):
Our love for music is our bond
And it will never fade
Together we will journey on
In a symphony that's never played.

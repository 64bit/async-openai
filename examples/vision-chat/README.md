The sky is partly cloudy with a rich blue color, and it seems to be a bright sunny day. This type of boardwalk is often constructed in natural areas to allow people to enjoy the scenery without disturbing the local flora and fauna. It provides a clear path through potentially marshy or sensitive ecosystems and can be found in nature reserves, parks, or conservation areas."

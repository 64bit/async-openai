The data has been successfully read. It seems to contain a `DATE` column and a `CASTHPI` column, which appears to be the price index. We can now proceed to generate the graph of the price index versus the year.

Let's extract the year from the `DATE` column and plot the graph.

The MIME type information is not available in the current context. Therefore, let's try reading the file using multiple approaches to handle potential file formats correctly (e.g., Excel and CSV).

We'll first try reading it as an Excel file specifying the engine. If it fails, we'll then attempt reading it as a CSV file.
[]
It appears that there was an issue determining the correct format of the file. It might be useful to check the file type. Let's attempt loading the file using a more general approach to ensure compatibility.
[]
Sure, let's begin by loading the data from the uploaded file to inspect its contents. This will help identify the relevant columns for 'price index' and 'year'. After that, we can proceed with generating the graph.

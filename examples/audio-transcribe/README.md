> Hello, I'm David Attenborough. I'm speaking to you from my home because, like many of you, I've spent much of the last year indoors, away from friends, family, and access to the natural world. It's been a challenging few months for many of us, but the reaction to these extraordinary times has proved that when we work together, there is no limit to what we can accomplish. Today, we are experiencing environmental change as never before. And the need to take action has never been more urgent. This year, the world will gather in Glasgow for the United Nations Climate Change Conference. It's a crucial moment in our history. This could be a year for positive change for ourselves, for our planet, and for the wonderful creatures with which we share it. A year the world could remember proudly and say, we made a difference. As we make our New Year's resolutions, let's think about what each of us could do. What positive changes could we make in our own lives? So here's to a brighter year ahead. Let's make 2021 a happy New Year for all the inhabitants of our perfect planet.
